# JSONInterpreter

## Purpose

This repository is meant as an educational resource on the subject of using software design patterns in iOS apps written in Swift.

## Problem

Acquiring data over the network from within a mobile app often requires not only data parsing (thus converting textual data into structured data), but also data interpretation (thus examining the structure of the resulting data and confirming that it matches expectations).

## Solution

JSONInterpreter is a small, sample utility library based on Swift generics that allows for methodical interpretation of structured data - be it JSON, XML, a dictionary of arrays, etc.

## Components
